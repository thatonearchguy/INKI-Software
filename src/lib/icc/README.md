# ICC - Inter Core Communication Library
## What is this?
This will eventually become the library that interfaces INKI's nRF52840
and nRF9160 MCUs, allowing them to control each other and communicate
in a sustainable, low-power, and secure way using their UARTE peripherals.

This will predominantely be used for requesting sensor data which will be 
connected to the nRF9160 in order to offload precious CPU, memory, and FLASH from the user-facing nRF52840, provide efficient background processing, and forge robust security. 

Watch this space!
