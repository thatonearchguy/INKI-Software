## What is INKI? :thought_balloon:
**INKI** Mark One is a premium open source smartwatch, born out of a desire to create a usable watch that could last 30 days on a single charge.  

INKI has since grown so much - in an age where tech monopolies relentlessly fight for your attention, we recognise that what the world really needs is technology that truly helps you. :relieved:

We aim to do just that. We want to create a watch that respects you and your time, a watch that serves you, not vice versa. We are building the software from the ground up to ensure nothing is secretly keeping tabs on you, plotting what ad to show you next. The best thing? You can see for yourself! INKI's Operating System will be open sourced under GPL-3.0, meaning you can help contribute to the codebase, implement features you want, and shape the development of the operating system into the future.
